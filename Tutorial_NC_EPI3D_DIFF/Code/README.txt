We will welcome Lucy Kershaw from Centre for Cardiovascular Science and Edinburgh Imaging Facilities and John Keen from The Royal School of Veterinary Studies and The Roslin Institute.

Lucy Kershaw is a Reader at University of Edinburgh and an MRI physicist working at the Edinburgh Imaging Facility QMRI. Before coming to Edinburgh, she worked in Manchester and Toronto, and her research focuses on the use of quantitative MRI in health and disease. She worked on quantitative imaging, accuracy and precision in DCE-MRI, T1 measurement, and comparison with other imaging modalities. Application of functional imaging to treatment planning, treatment monitoring and prognosis in a wide range of diseases and body areas including normal uterus and pancreas, and cancer of the prostate, cervix, bladder, head and neck. Recent work has been on novel contrast agents (Manganese, iron oxide) and joint imaging in the horse. 

John Keen is a senior clinician in the Equine Hospital and Chair of Equine Cardiovascular Science. His clinical and research interests include all aspects of internal medicine, but with particular emphasis on cardiovascular disease, metabolic and endocrine disease and the potential links between these disorders.  John has extensive experience  in equine clinical cardiology in particular and, with two colleagues, runs a peripatetic transvenous electrocardioversion (TVEC) service for treating atrial fibrillation in horses, across the UK.
